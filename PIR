PIR is partial infrared detect ir emitted by warm objects . THIS IS HCSR501

Sensing element is a pyroelectric sensing element
When motion detected gives a high signal

Duration can be adjusted by potentiometer  . Clockwise turning increases delay
Sensitivity also 2-7 m can be adjusted by potentiometer . Clockwise decreases the range

BISS001 is the control chip and converts analog signal to digital.\

Lens in front of the sensor is a fresnel lens and extends it's field of view


The sensing element has 2 parts . if the object crosses the first part at one instant of time  then it will cross the next one after a few moments
If BISS001 detects large difference between two values at one instant of time , then output is high

You don't even need arduino , if detection then high flows from output


------------------------------------------------------------------

Can connect 5V relay with our 5V PIR . Can check relay is activated using led glow . 
This sensor is best for animal detection

The high output from a pir can operate a transistor .
